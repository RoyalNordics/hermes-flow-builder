# build-v0.prompt.md

Begin Flowbuilder MVP setup. Follow all instructions in roo.rules.yaml.

1. Read roo.files.yaml and create all required directories if they do not exist.
2. Log each created directory in roo.status.log with a timestamp.
3. Await upload of required files into those directories.

Important:
- Do NOT build or validate anything else until all required files are uploaded.
- Use /flow-editor UI as the reference for how Flowbuilder should behave and look.

Once all folders exist and are logged, await further instruction.
